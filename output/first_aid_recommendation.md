**Immediate First Aid for Stomach Ache and Nausea:**

**1. Rest and Rehydration:** The first step is to encourage the patient to rest in a comfortable position.  Gentle movement might be preferable to lying completely still.  Offer sips of clear fluids, such as water, clear broth (if not vegetarian restrictions apply), or diluted electrolyte drinks (check the ingredients to ensure vegetarian suitability). Avoid sugary drinks or large quantities of liquid at once, as this can worsen nausea.  Small sips frequently are best.

**2. Identify Potential Causes (If Possible):**  While not directly treatable with first aid, try to determine if the nausea and stomach ache relate to something the patient recently ate or drank. This information will be helpful for medical professionals later.  However, avoid pressuring the patient if they are feeling unwell.

**3. BRAT Diet (If Tolerated):** If the nausea is subsiding and the patient feels able to eat, suggest bland foods such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT diet).  These are easy to digest and can help settle the stomach.  Adapt this to the patient's vegetarian diet; alternatives could include plain cooked potatoes or well-cooked vegetables like carrots.  Start with very small portions.

**4. Pain Management:** For mild to moderate pain, the patient can try applying a warm compress or heating pad to their abdomen. Avoid excessive heat.  Over-the-counter pain relief medication (such as acetaminophen/paracetamol) *might* be considered, but **only if** the patient has no contraindications or allergies to it and the packaging instructions are followed carefully.  **Important note:**  Never give medication to a person who is unconscious or severely ill.


**When to Seek Professional Medical Help:**

It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any of the following occur:

* **Severe or persistent pain:** Pain that is unrelenting, intense, or worsening despite rest and rehydration.
* **Bloody vomit or stool:** This indicates potential internal bleeding and requires urgent medical care.
* **High fever (above 101°F or 38.3°C):**  A high fever could suggest an infection.
* **Dehydration:** Signs include dizziness, lightheadedness, decreased urination, and dry mouth.  Dehydration can quickly become serious.
* **Inability to keep down fluids:** Persistent vomiting even small amounts of water can lead to dehydration.
* **Symptoms worsening:** If the stomach ache and nausea are progressively worsening or accompanied by other concerning symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness.
* **Symptoms persisting beyond 24 hours:**  If symptoms don't improve or resolve after 24 hours of home care.
